# what is this?

This is my solves + code for open quantum systems and the fundamentals behind quantum computing.

#### Worksheet 1:
simple unitary dynamics of single-qubit systems
The simulated hamiltonians include driven systems with time-dependent perturbations
A thorough study of the limits of the validity of the rotating wave approximaiton (RWA)
The last exercises iclude two-qubit dynamics and a XXY Ising model for an open chain with 5 to 9 spings

### Worksheet 2:
Dynamics for mixed states (
)
Properties of thermal states
Biased multi-sided coin distributions
Decoherence of a qubit due to transition frequency being a Gaussian random variable
CPTP map for spontaneous emission using Kraus operators
Two-qubit dynamics with interaction and purity of reduced density matrix

#### Worksheet 3:
Fluctuations of position and momentum of a simple harmonic hamiltonian
Driven harmonic oscillator (analytical and numerical approach)
Two coupled harmonic oscillators
Husimi-Q functions of cat states (superposition) and mixed states. Both of coherent states
Husimi-Q function of Fock state and Hilbert space trucation for infinite-dimensional oscillators
Simulation of quadratic hamiltonians using displacement vector and correlation matrix dynamics. Evolution of bipartite Fock and coherent states
M-mode quadratic hamiltonian with dynamical simulation of a thermalisation process

#### Worksheet 4: 

Can't do 2-qubit stuff (yet).
